For Simplicity, I have structured the content in the form of directories.

1)Dataset: In this section, I have placed all the Data Files (Cleaned) used in the Project.
	  Due to Space problem, I have only placed the test data. Rest all files are available at 
	https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IWTACexzPJqYPqKeXtZ3ZHz37Mcn6DhG?usp=sharing
2)Jupyter Notebook: In this section, I have placed all the Jupyter Notebooks that I have used to solve this Project. 
3)Model_Save: In this section, I have saved all the model files so that next time just we need to used to pre-trained values.



The following dependencies are used in my Project

1) Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
2) Python (v3.7.6)
3) Numpy 
4) MNE 
5) Scipy

To install all requirements, type
>> pip install requirement.txt 


Every Code and Jupyter Notebook is properly commented for better understanding.
